<p><strong>Primary &amp; secondary education, freelance work:</strong> I was homeschooled part-time from the age of 6, and then full-time from the age of 10. At 14, I had completed the equivalent of a high-school education, and chose to pursue a career in music as a freelance composer. At the age of 20, however, spurred by newfound interests in programming, logic, and the foundations of mathematics and computer science, I became determined to study these subjects at a research level. Applying to universities posed a challenge given my background, as I lacked a high-school diploma and most other qualifications expected for an undergraduate application, but by 2018 I had successfully applied and been admitted to my current degree program at Oxford.</p>
<h3 id="research-experience-grants">Research Experience &amp; Grants</h3>
<p><strong>Undergraduate research project:</strong> Church Encodings in Higher-Dimensional Type Theory – Toward a Theory of Abstraction (2020)</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent research project funded by grant from the Merton Summer Projects Scheme: <a href="https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects">https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects</a></li>
<li>Investigated combining constructs from cubical type theory for the type-theoretic treatment of propositional equality with modalities from quantitative type theory (as defined by Abel, Atkey, and McBride) for tracking usage of computational resources.</li>
<li>Demonstrated the ability to internally prove parametricity theorems and derive induction principles for Church-encoded datatypes in a type theory combining cubical and quantitative methods.</li>
<li>Supervisor: Luke Ong</li>
<li>Project report submitted to Merton College available at:<br> <a href="https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/Aberle%2C%20Connor_0.pdf">https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/Aberle%2C%20Connor_0.pdf</a></li>

<h3 id="skills-interests">Skills &amp; Interests</h3>
<p><strong>Programming/IT:</strong> I am proficient at programming in Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp, Scala, and C, as well as typesetting technical documents in LaTeX, including complicated diagrams arising in category theory, automata theory, etc. I designed my website <a href="https://www.cbaberle.com">www.cbaberle.com</a> from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> music composition and theory remain passions from my pre-university years, and I am keenly interested in applications of computer science and mathematics to problems of analysis and expression in music and the arts more generally; a sampling of my musical work can be found on my website at: <a href="https://www.cbaberle.com/music">www.cbaberle.com/music</a></p>

<p><strong>Primary &amp; secondary education, freelance work:</strong> I
was homeschooled part-time from the age of 6, and then full-time from
the age of 10, due to me being far enough ahead of my grade level in
school that skipping grades was infeasible. At 14, I had completed the
equivalent of a high-school education, and chose to pursue a career in
music as a freelance composer. At the age of 20, however, spurred by
newfound interests in programming, logic, and the foundations of
mathematics and computer science, I became determined to study these
subjects at a research level. Applying to universities posed a challenge
given my background, as I lacked a high-school diploma and most other
qualifications expected for an undergraduate application, but by 2018 I
had successfully applied and been admitted to the University of Oxford,
where I studied for five years, and was subsequently admitted to my
current position as a PhD student at CMU.</p>

<p><strong>Undergraduate research project:</strong> Church Encodings in
Higher-Dimensional Type Theory – Toward a Theory of Abstraction
(2020)</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent research project funded by grant from the Merton Summer
Projects Scheme: <a
href="https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects">https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects</a></li>
<li>Investigated combining constructs from cubical type theory for the
type-theoretic treatment of propositional equality with modalities from
quantitative type theory (as defined by Abel, Atkey, and McBride) for
tracking usage of computational resources.</li>
<li>Demonstrated the ability to internally prove parametricity theorems
and derive induction principles for Church-encoded datatypes in a type
theory combining cubical and quantitative methods.</li>
<li>Supervisor: Luke Ong</li>

<h3 id="skills-interests">Skills &amp; Interests</h3>
<p><strong>Programming/IT:</strong> I am proficient at programming in
Agda, Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp, Scala, and C, as well as typesetting
technical documents in LaTeX, including complicated diagrams arising in
category theory, automata theory, etc. I designed my website <a
href="https://www.cbaberle.com">www.cbaberle.com</a> from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> music composition and theory remain passions
from my pre-university years, and I am keenly interested in applications
of computer science and mathematics to problems of analysis and
expression in music and the arts more generally; a sampling of my
musical work can be found on my website at: <a

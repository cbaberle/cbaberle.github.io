<span class="dropcap">I</span> am a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am studying for a PhD in Pure and Applied Logic, advised by Frank Pfenning. My undergraduate studies were at Merton College, University of Oxford, where I obtained a BA in Computer Science and Philosophy.

I am principally interested in the design and analysis of formal/computational systems – i.e. programming languages, logical frameworks, automated theorem provers, etc. – that enable and enhance the production and organization of human knowledge and expression. Toward this end, the central aim of my research is to develop a greater understanding of the abstract, mathematical principles that underlie such systems, using concepts and methods from category theory, type theory, and mathematical logic.

My personal wiki and digital garden – [The Hyrax Project](https://hyrax.cbaberle.com) – is an online formalization project, written in Agda, that serves as a public repository for my thoughts on all things computational, mathematical, and philosophical, with a particular emphasis on categorical logic, type theory, and synthetic mathematics.

In a former life, I was an aspiring composer, and I still spend much of my spare time writing music; you can find a selection of my compositions [here](music.html).

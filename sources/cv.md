**Primary & secondary education, freelance work:** I was homeschooled part-time from the age of 6, and then full-time from the age of 10, due to me being far enough ahead of my grade level in school that skipping grades was infeasible. At 14, I had completed the equivalent of a high-school education, and chose to pursue a career in music as a freelance composer. At the age of 20, however, spurred by newfound interests in programming, logic, and the foundations of mathematics and computer science, I became determined to study these subjects at a research level. Applying to universities posed a challenge given my background, as I lacked a high-school diploma and most other qualifications expected for an undergraduate application, but by 2018 I had successfully applied and been admitted to the University of Oxford, where I studied for five years, and was subsequently admitted to my current position as a PhD student at CMU.

### Research Experience & Grants

**Undergraduate research project:** Church Encodings in Higher-Dimensional Type Theory – Toward a Theory of Abstraction (2020)

* Independent research project funded by grant from the Merton Summer Projects Scheme: [https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects](https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects)
* Investigated combining constructs from cubical type theory for the type-theoretic treatment of propositional equality with modalities from quantitative type theory (as defined by Abel, Atkey, and McBride) for tracking usage of computational resources.
* Demonstrated the ability to internally prove parametricity theorems and derive induction principles for Church-encoded datatypes in a type theory combining cubical and quantitative methods.
* Supervisor: Luke Ong
* Project report submitted to Merton College available at:<br> [https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/Aberle%2C%20Connor_0.pdf](https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/Aberle%2C%20Connor_0.pdf)

### Skills & Interests

**Programming/IT:** I am proficient at programming in Agda, Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp, Scala, and C, as well as typesetting technical documents in LaTeX, including complicated diagrams arising in category theory, automata theory, etc. I designed my website [www.cbaberle.com](https://www.cbaberle.com) from scratch.

**Music:** music composition and theory remain passions from my pre-university years, and I am keenly interested in applications of computer science and mathematics to problems of analysis and expression in music and the arts more generally; a sampling of my musical work can be found on my website at: [www.cbaberle.com/music](https://www.cbaberle.com/music)

### Research Interests

Type theory; constructive logic & mathematics; categorical logic & topos theory; applied category theory; semantics of computation; formal epistemology; programming language theory.

### Education & work experience

**BA Computer Science and Philosophy, Merton College, University of Oxford** (2018-2022)

* Expected First class
* Ranked 1st out of cohort of 13 Computer Science and Philosophy students in preliminary examinations
* *Relevant coursework*:
  * **Computer Science/Mathematics:** Functional Programming; Imperative Programming; Design and Analysis of Algorithms; Discrete Mathematics; Probability; Models of Computation; Algorithms and Data Structures; Logic and Proof; Principles of Programming Languages; Compilers; $\lambda$-Calculus and Types; Computational Complexity; Linear Algebra; Continuous Mathematics; Information Theory; Set Theory
  * **Philosophy:** General Philosophy; Elements of Deductive Logic; Philosophy of Mathematics; Philosophical Logic; Philosophy of Science
* *Academic awards*: 
  * **University of Oxford Department of Computer Science:** Gibbs Prize for Preliminary Examinations in Computer Science and Philosophy (2018-2019)
  * **Merton College:** Exhibition scholarship for outstanding academic performance (awarded 2019, renewed 2020)
  * **Merton College:** Postmaster scholarship in recognition of sustained academic excellence (promoted from Exhibition in 2021)
  * **Merton College:** Summer Projects Scheme undergraduate research grant (awarded 2020, see ‘research experience & grants’ below)

**Primary & secondary education, freelance work:** I was homeschooled part-time from the age of 6, and then full-time from the age of 10. At 14, I had completed the equivalent of a high-school education, and chose to pursue a career in music as a freelance composer. At the age of 20, however, spurred by newfound interests in programming, logic, and the foundations of mathematics and computer science, I became determined to study these subjects at a research level. Applying to universities posed a challenge given my background, as I lacked a high-school diploma and most other qualifications expected for an undergraduate application, but by 2018 I had successfully applied and been admitted to my current degree program at Oxford.

### Research Experience & Grants

**Undergraduate research project:** Church Encodings in Higher-Dimensional Type Theory – Toward a Theory of Abstraction (2020)

* Independent research project funded by grant from the Merton Summer Projects Scheme: [https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects](https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/new-york-nightclubbing-and-laser-accelerators-college-funds-10-student-summer-projects)
* Investigated combining constructs from cubical type theory for the type-theoretic treatment of propositional equality with modalities from quantitative type theory (as defined by Abel, Atkey, and McBride) for tracking usage of computational resources.
* Demonstrated the ability to internally prove parametricity theorems and derive induction principles for Church-encoded datatypes in a type theory combining cubical and quantitative methods.
* Supervisor: Luke Ong

### Skills & Interests

**Programming/IT:** I am proficient at programming in Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp, Scala, and C, as well as typesetting technical documents in LaTeX, including complicated diagrams arising in category theory, automata theory, etc. I designed my website [www.cbaberle.com](https://www.cbaberle.com) from scratch.

**Music:** music composition and theory remain passions from my pre-university years, and I am keenly interested in applications of computer science and mathematics to problems of analysis and expression in music and the arts more generally; a sampling of my musical work can be found on my website at: [www.cbaberle.com/music](https://www.cbaberle.com/music)
